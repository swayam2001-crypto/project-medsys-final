                A PO is a collective of farmers (and non-farmers) who are the primary producers of a product (an
                agricultural produce or a manufactured product). It, therefore, can work as a platform to facilitate
                better access to government services, like PDS, MNREGA, Scholarships and Pensions, etc.!!</p><br />

                  <p className="gap" style={{fontFamily: '"Times New Roman", Times, serif'}}>A Producer Company was introduced
                    in India with the Companies Act, 2013. It gives
                    persons engaged in activities related to producing (what has been grown or produced,
                    particularly by farming) the opportunity to form a company. A producer company can be formed by
                    10 or more producers (persons involved in, or in activities related to, produce or growth), two
                    or more producer institutions or a combination of 10 or more producers and producer
                    institutions. Such a company can only have equity capital, require a minimum of five directors
                    and an authorised capital of Rs. 5 lakh. The procedure for forming a Producer company is similar
                    to the one for forming a private limited company.

                  <br />
                  <h3>Production Businesses</h3>
                  <p>
                    The main functions of producer companies are production, procurement or manufacture of any
                    primary produce for its members (for further sale) and to others.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3> Marketing Businesses</h3>
                  <p>
                    Even a business involved in the marketing or promotion of primary produce or provision of
                    educational services to members and others can constitute itself as a producer company.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3> Technical Service Businesses</h3>
                  <p> Any business offering technical assistance to producers, providing training and educational
                    services or conducting research and development can register as a producer company.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3> Businesses</h3>
                  <p>
                    Any business financing producer activities, be it in the production, marketing or development
                    domain, can register itself as a producer company.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3>Infrastructure Businesses</h3>
                  <p>
                    Businesses involved in providing infrastructure to producers, whether in the form of
                    electricity, water resources, irrigation techniques, land utilisation, or consultation with
                    regard to the same, may constitute themselves as a producer company.

                  <h1>Advantages of a Producer Company</h1>
                  <br />
                  <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
                  <p>
                    All businesses can run the risk of not being able to repay their liabilities. It is a necessary
                    evil. In this event, a sole proprietor (or individual producer) would be personally liable for
                    all
                    the debts of the business. The members of a producer company, on the other hand, have unlimited
                    liability as the company is an entity in itself. Therefore, only the amount invested in the
                    business
                    would be lost; the personal property of the directors would be safe.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3>Economies Of Scale</h3>
                  <p>
                    Only 15% of India's farmers own over two acres of land. The majority of farmers are, therefore,
                    unable to safely unlock the advantages that come with economies of scale. With a producer
                    company,
                    multiple farmers can work as a collective and lower costs, reduce risk and even get access to
                    better
                    credit facilities. This enables better planning and bargaining power with buyers.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3> Better Management</h3>
                  <p>
                    Rather than a single farmer managing the entire business, work within a producer company can be
                    divided between its directors. The entity is managed by the Board of Management, which has a
                    tenure of five years. Also, a Producer company has a separate legal existence, which means that
                    it isn't affected by the death of any of its members.

                  <h3>5 Business Days</h3>
                  <p> A minimum of five directors must apply for a DSC, which is necessary to file the company
                    registration documents. For this, you will only need to provide a few scanned documents and
                    details; our representatives will fill the form and submit it online.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h3>7 Business Days</h3>
                  <p>
                    As soon as we apply for the DSC, we will prepare the SPICe i.e. INC-32 documents. These
                    documents will take around a week to prepare, and will include the name for your company, the
                    Memorandum of Association (MoA) and Articles of Association (AoA). Once these documents are
                    prepared satisfactorily, they will be submitted to the RoC.

                    10 TO 15 Business Days</h3>
                  <p>
                    Depending on the workload of the RoC, the documents will be approved in 10 to 15 days. Once
                    approved, the Certificate of Incorporation will be mailed to your registered office address.
                    With this document, you can apply for a Permanent Account Number (PAN) and Tax Account Number
                    (TAN), both of which are necessary for opening a bank account in the name of the busines
